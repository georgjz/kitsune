# Kitsune v0.2-prealpha
This is a simple tool that will convert a pixel image file into
the 2bpp, 4bpp or 8bpp bitplane format used by the SNES to display objects with
corresponding palette data. Kitsune uses Qt.

## Usage
After compiling and starting Kitsune, use the File menu to open a file and
the Image menu to export a Tileset. WARNING: As of now, the tile size is fixed
to 8 by 8 pixels, and the bit format to 4bpp. This is preAlpha and should change
soon.

Note that this was written in a nightly session, so it is highly unoptimized
and experimental. Use at own risk. Was successfully tested on Windows with Cgywin
and Linux.
